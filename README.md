# Mapping_Earthquakes
---

## Purpose
Visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
Use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Results
Using GeoJSON data we created multiple layers of earthquake mapping over the past 7 days. Since these calls come from live data this will be a constant use map. Anyone with a valid mapbox API key has access to this data.
